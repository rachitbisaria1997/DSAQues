select name from tableA
union

union all gives duplicates also
select name from tableA

//sub queries

select name, marks from student where marks > (select avg(marks) from student);

select name, roll from student where rollNo in (select rollNo from student where rollNo % 2 == 0);

create view view1 as
select rollno, name from student;

select * from view1;
drop view view1;

helps in restricting users in viewing sensitive columns
like phone-number

CREATE VIEW customer_public AS
SELECT customer_name, city
FROM customers;

select * from student where name like 'S%';
name starting with S;

select * from student where firstName like '[bsp]%';
firstName starts with bs or p

dropping index

alter table person
drop constraint cons_name;

group by name
having count(*) > 1;

Find Duplicate Records

select name, count(*) from employee
group by name
having count(*) > 1;

Find Employees Who Don’t Have a Manager

Find Department-Wise Highest Salary
SELECT department_id, MAX(salary) AS max_salary
FROM employees
GROUP BY department_id;

Count Employees Department-Wise

select dept_id , count(*) as total_employees
from employees
group by dept_id;


Q. find 2nd highest salary department wise

select e1.name, e1.department, max(e1.salary)
from Employee e1
where e1.salary < (select max(e2.salary) from Employee e2
where e1.department = e2.department
) group by e1.department;

Q. how to prevent SQL injection ?

Use PreparedStatement instead of Statement.

String query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ? AND password = ?";
PreparedStatement pstmt = connection.prepareStatement(query);
pstmt.setString(1, username);
pstmt.setString(2, password);
ResultSet rs = pstmt.executeQuery();


Q. Different types of index in SQL

1. Unique index - Ensures that values in the indexed column(s) are unique
create table users(
  id int auto_increment primary key,
  username varchar(20),
  email varchar(20),
  unique(email);
);

INSERT INTO Users (username, email) VALUES ('Alice', 'alice@example.com');
INSERT INTO Users (username, email) VALUES ('Bob', 'alice@example.com');  -- ❌ Error: Duplicate key

2. Clustered index - data rows are stored in the order of clustered_index. table can have only 1 clustered index.

CREATE TABLE Orders (
    order_id INT PRIMARY KEY,  -- Automatically becomes a Clustered Index
    order_date DATE,
    customer_id INT
);

Data rows in the table are stored in the order of order_id.

3. non clustered index

CREATE TABLE Products (
    product_id INT PRIMARY KEY,  -- Clustered Index
    name VARCHAR(100),
    category VARCHAR(50),
    price DECIMAL(10,2)
);

create index idx_category ON Products(category);

data itself is not sorted by category index as its non clustered

Q. how to do transactions in SQL
A Transaction is a sequence of one or more SQL operations (queries) that are treated as a single unit of work.
Once a transaction is committed, changes are permanent even if system crashes

if any error occurs, than rollback the changes

Begin transaction

insert into UserAccount(user_id, email) values(1, 'user@example,com');

update Account SET balance = balance - 100 where user_id = 1;

COMMIT;

EXCEPTION
 when others then
 Rollback;

End;
